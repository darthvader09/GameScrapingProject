# GameScrapingProject

Main.py is the starting file and includes the flask function. This helps us to see the actual final and finished product clearly. It displays a window and shows us the table and the picture of the game we search. The file includes the flask render template which we use to render our data.

Index.html is the actual window where we can organize our data. We put the labels and text of the table in there to display it correctly.

Game.py is the file where we use webscraping to make functions for displaying our data in the render template and the window. We use wikipedia as our source to webscrape from and use the functions from there. We make our image function, game name function, and our table text function.
